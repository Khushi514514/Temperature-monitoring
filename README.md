# Temperature Monitoring System (Online Simulation)

This project is a **Temperature Monitoring System** built using software-based simulation (no physical hardware required). It simulates temperature data and displays it in real-time through a simple Python interface or web interface. It can also be extended to trigger alerts based on threshold values.

## Features

- Simulated temperature sensor data (random or logic-based)
- Real-time temperature updates
- Threshold-based alert system
- Clean console or GUI-based output
- Customizable update intervals and limits

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter / Streamlit / Flask (for GUI or web output) *(choose one based on your implementation)*
- Matplotlib / Plotly (optional, for graphs)
- Random (for temperature simulation)
- JSON or CSV (for logging data)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temperature-monitoring-system.git
cd temperature-monitoring-system
